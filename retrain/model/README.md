# Model (`retrain.model`)

This directory is responsible for managing the core AI model that the `retrain` project works with. It handles everything related to the model that will be fine-tuned or retrained.

It contains the necessary code to:

1.  **Load the Model:** Initializes the pre-trained AI model. A consistent approach (`model.py`) is used for loading different types of models, ensuring uniformity whether they are standard Hugging Face models or optimized versions like those from Unsloth.
    *   `hf.py`: Manages the loading of standard models via the Hugging Face library.
    *   `unsloth.py`: Manages the loading of models using the Unsloth library, which is optimized for speed and memory efficiency.

2.  **Prepare for Efficient Updates (PEFT/LoRA):** To avoid the computational expense of retraining an entire large model, `retrain` can uses Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). This involves adding small, trainable components to the existing model instead of modifying all its parameters. The base model structure (`model.py`) includes a method (`peft`) to apply these PEFT configurations, enabling faster and more resource-friendly fine-tuning. This is supported for both standard and Unsloth model types.

3.  **Generate Outputs:** Allows the loaded model to produce outputs (e.g., text) based on given inputs.

4.  **Update the Model:** Facilitates the modification of the model's trainable parameters—primarily those within the PEFT/LoRA components—during the retraining process. This allows the model to learn new information or skills.
