# sepa-semantic: Does SEPA separate from baseline with semantic planning detection?
#
# Same design as sepa-ramp, but uses embedding-based planning token detection
# instead of hardcoded strategic grams (which matched only 0.05% of tokens).
#
# 2 conditions x 3 seeds x 100 steps = 6 runs
#
# Run: retrain campaigns/sepa-semantic.toml
