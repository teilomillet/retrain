# sepa-semantic: Does SEPA separate from baseline with semantic planning detection?
#
# Baseline (grpo+none) doesn't use planning detection, so we reuse the
# 3 baseline runs from sepa-ramp. Only the SEPA condition needs re-running
# with the semantic detector.
#
# 1 condition x 3 seeds x 100 steps = 3 runs
# Compare against: logs/campaign_20260222_085036/runs/grpo+none_s{42,101,202}
#
# Run: retrain campaigns/sepa-semantic.toml
