# sepa-ramp: Does SEPA at full λ separate from baseline?
#
# Key insight from teilo.xyz/posts/sepa: λ never exceeded 0.10 because
# runs were truncated at 12-20 steps with 50-step delay.
# This experiment lets λ reach 1.0 over 100 steps.
#
# 2 conditions x 3 seeds x 100 steps = 6 runs (~76k episodes)
# Budget: ~half the original pilot
#
# Run: retrain campaigns/sepa-ramp.toml
