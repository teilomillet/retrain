# sepa-ablation: HICRA condition to isolate SEPA's specific effect
#
# We already have grpo+none (3 seeds) and maxrl+gtpo_sepa (3 seeds)
# from sepa-ramp. This adds the HICRA condition for direct comparison.
#
# The key comparison: SEPA vs HICRA (same pipeline, different transform)
# - Both use MaxRL + GTPO + planning tokens
# - HICRA amplifies planning advantages
# - SEPA pools execution entropy
#
# 1 condition x 3 seeds x 100 steps = 3 runs (~38k episodes)
#
# Run: retrain campaigns/sepa-ablation.toml
